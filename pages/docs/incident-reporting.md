**We take incidents seriously.** 

Examples of incidents include, but are not limited to:
- A certificate issued in violation of our policies and practices
- A certificate used for fraud, phishing, or other inappropriate conduct
- Certificate private key compromise
- A bug or vulnerability related to the U.S. Federal Public Trust Transport Layer Security Public Key Infrastructure

**If you'd like to report an incident**, email <a href="mailto:{{site.incident_email}}">{{site.incident_email}}</a> with the information below:
- Name
- Email address
- Phone number (optional)
- Agency/organization affiliation
- Website Uniform Resource Locator where the certificate is installed
- Description of the incident

You can expect an initial response from our team within 24 hours, but we may need to follow-up with you for more information. Section 4.9 of the [Certificate Policy]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/cp/#49-certificate-revocation-and-suspension) describes requirements for certificate revocation in the event of compromise or misissuance, meaning a certificate was issued in violation of our policies and practices.
