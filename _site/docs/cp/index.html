<h2 id="1-introduction">1. INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3 id="11-overview">1.1 Overview</h3>
<p>This Certificate Policy (CP) outlines the policy and requirements for the United States (U.S.) Federal Public Key Infrastructure in the issuance and management of U.S. Federal Publicly-Trusted TLS Certificates.  The certificates under this policy are for identifying and authenticating U.S. Federal Government web services.</p>

<p>This policy is for a hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure restricted to services operated by or on behalf of the U.S. Federal Government.  The hierarchical PKI is referenced as the <strong>U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI</strong> in this document.</p>

<p>This document serves two purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To specify the U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI Certificate Policy and requirements, and</li>
  <li>To provide requirements for what each Certification Authority shall address in its Certification Practice Statement</li>
</ul>

<p>This policy promotes automation to improve U.S. Federal Government efficiencies.</p>

<p>In accordance with RFC 3647, this CP includes all nine sections of the RFC 3647 framework and an additional addendum with the certificate profiles.</p>

<p>This policy is applicable to all Certification Authorities within a chain of trust under the <strong>U.S. Federal TLS Root CA</strong>.</p>

<p>The terms and provisions of this certificate policy shall be interpreted under and governed by applicable Federal law.</p>

<p>This document was originally based on the CAB Forum Baseline Requirements, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. All adaptations and modifications made to create this CP are in the United States public domain as works of the U.S. Government, and released internationally under the Creative Commons (CCO) 1.0 Universal Public Domain dedication.</p>

<h4 id="111-scope">1.1.1 Scope</h4>
<p>The scope of the U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI includes the Certification Authorities used for issuing and managing Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for U.S. Federal Government services.  The scope is limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Services that resolve at a registered Internet subdomain under the .gov and .mil Top Level Domains</li>
  <li>Services that are accessible on the Internet</li>
</ul>

<p>U.S. Federal Government departments and agencies own and operate services that are not accessible on the Internet and are only accessible from the U.S. Government’s intranets and internal networks.  These intranet only services should consider using TLS certificates from CAs used for the Federal Enterprise in lieu of the Publicly-Trusted certificates covered under this policy.  The Federal Enterprise CAs could include only locally trusted CAs operated by the department or agency or a CA operated under one of the other Federal PKI certificate policies.</p>

<p>The intranet only services may apply for TLS certificates issued under this policy if: i) the identification and authentication requirements (Section 3) can be met in entirety, and ii) the information to be contained in the certificate can be publicly disclosed without any redaction.</p>

<h4 id="112-compliance">1.1.2 Compliance</h4>
<p>This Certificate Policy conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates published at https://www.cabforum.org. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Baseline Requirements, those Baseline Requirements take precedence over this document.</p>

<h4 id="113-certificate-types">1.1.3 Certificate Types</h4>
<p>This Certificate Policy defines five (5) different types of certificates.  Certificates issued under this policy are categorized as CA Certificates, Subscriber or Infrastructure Certificates.</p>

<h5 id="1131-ca-certificates">1.1.3.1 CA Certificates</h5>
<p>A certificate is a CA certificate if the basicConstraints extension is present and has cA:TRUE.  CA certificates allowed to be issued under this policy are categorized as Root CA certificates and Subordinate CA certificates.</p>

<h5 id="11311-root-ca-certificates">1.1.3.1.1 Root CA Certificates</h5>
<p>A CA certificate is a Root CA certificate if the certificate’s issuer and subject are the same and the digital signature may be verified by the public key bound into the certificate.</p>

<h5 id="11312-subordinate-ca-certificates">1.1.3.1.2 Subordinate CA Certificates</h5>
<p>A CA certificate is a Subordinate CA certificate if the certificate’s issuer and the subject are not the same.  Subordinate CA certificates, issued under this policy, have a Path Length Constraint set to zero (0) and Name Constraints specifying permitted dNSName sub-trees only for the .gov and .mil Top Level Domains.</p>

<h5 id="1132-subscriber-certificates">1.1.3.2 Subscriber Certificates</h5>
<p>A certificate is a Subscriber certificate if it is not a CA Certificate.  Subscriber certificates are end entity certificates as defined in RFC 5280 and issued to subjects that are not authorized to issue certificates. Subscriber certificates allowed to be issued under this policy are categorized as Domain Validation TLS Server Authentication certificates, or Organization Validation TLS Server Authentication certificates.  CAs shall not issue Subscriber Certificates that simultaneously meet the criteria of more than one of these categories.</p>

<h5 id="11321-domain-validation-tls-server-authentication-certificates">1.1.3.2.1 Domain Validation TLS Server Authentication Certificates</h5>
<p>A Domain Validation TLS Server Authentication, issued under this policy: i) does not contain any information in the subject distinguished name other than commonName (OID 2.5.4.3) and countryName (OID 2.5.4.6), and ii) asserts a key purpose of id-kp-serverAuth (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) in the Extended Key Usage certificate extension.</p>

<h5 id="11322-organization-validation-tls-server-authentication-certificates">1.1.3.2.2 Organization Validation TLS Server Authentication Certificates</h5>
<p>An Organization Validation TLS Server Authentication certificate, issued under this policy: i) contains commonName (OID 2.5.4.3), stateOrProvinceName (OID 2.5.4.8), organizationName (OID 2.5.4.10) and countryName (OID 2.5.4.6) in the subject distinguished name, and ii) asserts a key purpose of id-kp-serverAuth (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) in the Extended Key Usage certificate extension.</p>

<h4 id="1133-infrastructure-certificates">1.1.3.3 Infrastructure Certificates</h4>
<p>A certificate is an Infrastructure certificate if it is not a CA Certificate and issued in support of the CA System.  Infrastructure certificates are end entity certificates as defined in RFC 5280 and issued to subjects that are not authorized to issue certificates. Infrastructure certificates allowed to be issued under this policy are categorized as Delegated OCSP Responder certificates.</p>

<h5 id="11331-delegated-ocsp-responder-certificates">1.1.3.3.1 Delegated OCSP Responder Certificates</h5>
<p>A certificate is a Delegated OCSP Responder Certificate if it has a key purpose of id-kp-OCSPSigning (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) in the Extended Key Usage certificate extension.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The requested Domain Name is within the .mil or .gov sTLD domain space</li>
  <li>Information provided by the Domain Name Registrar</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control">3.2.2.4 Validation of Domain Authorization or Control</h4>
<p>CAs shall confirm that, as of the date the Certificate was issued, the CA has validated each Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) listed in the Certificate using at least one of the methods listed in Section 3.2.2.4.x.</p>

<p>This CP allows for procedures adhering to the Baseline Requirements and is limited to three (3) validation methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Section 3.2.2.4.6 Agreed-Upon Change to Website</li>
  <li>Section 3.2.2.4.7 DNS Change</li>
  <li>Section 3.2.2.4.12 Validating Applicant as a Domain Contact</li>
</ul>

<p>Wildcard FQDNs are not allowed to be validated using Section 3.2.2.4.6 Agreed Upon Change to Website.  All wildcard domain names included in a certificate shall require validation by either Section 3.2.2.4.7 DNS Change, or Section 3.2.2.4.12 Validating Applicant as a Domain Contact signed by the Domain Contact authorizing the issuing of a certificate to include the wildcard FQDN.</p>

<p>CAs shall maintain a record of which domain validation method, including the relevant Baseline Requirements version number, was used to validate each domain in a certificate.</p>

<p>Completed confirmations of Applicant authority may be valid for the issuance of multiple certificates over time. In all cases, the confirmation shall have been completed within the time period specified in Section 4.2.1 of this policy prior to certificate issuance.</p>

<p>For purposes of domain validation, the term Applicant includes the Applicant’s U.S. Government Department, Agency, Commission, component, or other organizational unit defined in United States Code.</p>

<p>This validation method defined by the Baseline Requirements is not allowed under this CP.</p>

<h5 id="32246-agreed-upon-change-to-website">3.2.2.4.6 Agreed-Upon Change to Website</h5>
<p>This validation method confirms the Applicant’s control over the requested FQDN by confirming one of the following under the “/.well-known/pki-validation” directory, or another path registered with IANA for the purpose of Domain Validation, on the Authorization Domain Name that is accessible by the CA via HTTP/HTTPS over an Authorized Port:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The presence of Required Website Content contained in the content of a file or on a web page in the form of a meta tag. The entire Required Website Content shall not appear in the request used to retrieve the file or web page, or</li>
  <li>The presence of the Request Token or Random Value contained in the content of a file or on a webpage in the form of a meta tag where the Request Token or Random Value shall not appear in the request.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a Random Value is used, the CA shall provide a Random Value unique to the certificate request and shall not use the Random Value after 30 days.</p>

<p>A Request Token shall incorporate the key used in the certificate request.  A Request Token may include a timestamp to indicate when it was created and other information to ensure its uniqueness.  A Request Token that includes a timestamp shall remain valid for no more than 30 days from the time of creation.  A Request Token that includes a timestamp shall be treated as invalid if its timestamp is in the future. A Request Token that does not include a timestamp is valid for a single use and the CA shall not re-use it for a subsequent validation.</p>

<p>The binding shall use a digital signature algorithm or a cryptographic hash algorithm at least as strong as that to be used in signing the certificate request.</p>

<p>Examples of Request Tokens include, but are not limited to: (i) a hash of the public key; (ii) a hash of the Subject Public Key Info [X.509]; and (iii) a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR. A Request Token may also be concatenated with a timestamp or other data.</p>

<p>The CA shall define in its CPS the format of Request Tokens it accepts and shall document the “/.well-known/pki-validation/” directory and any other paths registered with IANA.</p>

<h5 id="32247-dns-change">3.2.2.4.7 DNS Change</h5>
<p>This validation method confirms the Applicant’s control over the FQDN by confirming the presence of a Random Value or Request Token in a DNS CNAME, TXT or CAA record for either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Authorization Domain Name</li>
  <li>An Authorization Domain Name that is prefixed with a label that begins with an underscore character.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a Random Value is used, the CA shall provide a Random Value unique to the Certificate request and shall not use the Random Value after 30 days.</p>

<p>A Request Token shall incorporate the key used in the certificate request.  A Request Token may include a timestamp to indicate when it was created and other information to ensure its uniqueness.  A Request Token that includes a timestamp shall remain valid for no more than 30 days from the time of creation.  A Request Token that includes a timestamp shall be treated as invalid if its timestamp is in the future. A Request Token that does not include a timestamp is valid for a single use and the CA shall not re-use it for a subsequent validation.</p>

<p>Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, the CA may also issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN.  For example, a validation for the example “myapp.mydomain.gov” may be used during the timeframe permitted for reuse of validation information to issue a certificate that includes “home.myapp.mydomain.gov”.</p>

<h5 id="32248-ip-address">3.2.2.4.8 IP Address</h5>

<p>IP Addresses are not allowed in the certificate profiles under this CP.</p>

<h4 id="3226-wildcard-domain-validation">3.2.2.6 Wildcard Domain Validation</h4>
<p>Before issuing a certificate with a wildcard character (*) in a CN or subjectAltName, the CA shall establish and follow a documented procedure and technical controls that determines if the wildcard character occurs in the first label position to the left of the .gov and .mil suffixes (e.g. *.gov, *.mil). If a wildcard would fall within the label immediately to the left of the .gov and .mil suffixes (e.g. *.gov, *.mil), the CA shall refuse issuance.  All CAs are prohibited from issuing any Wildcard Certificate to the entire sTLDs for .gov and .mil.</p>

<p>Wildcard FQDNs are not allowed to be validated using Section 3.2.2.4.6 Agreed Upon Change to Website or Section 3.2.2.4.10 TLS Using a Random Number.  All wildcard FQDNs included in a certificate shall require validation by Section 3.2.2.4.7 DNS Change, or Section 3.2.2.4.5 Domain Authorization Document signed by the Domain Contact authorizing the issuing of a certificate to include the wildcard FQDN.</p>

<h4 id="3227-data-source-accuracy">3.2.2.7 Data Source Accuracy</h4>
<p>Prior to using any data source as a Reliable Data Source, the CA shall evaluate the source for its reliability, accuracy, and resistance to alteration or falsification. The CA should consider the following during its evaluation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The age of the information provided,</li>
  <li>The frequency of updates to the information source,</li>
  <li>The data provider and purpose of the data collection,</li>
  <li>The public accessibility of the data availability, and</li>
  <li>The relative difficulty in falsifying or altering the data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Databases maintained by the CA or affiliated government agencies do not qualify as a Reliable Data Source if the primary purpose of the database is to collect information for the purpose of fulfilling the validation requirements under Section 3.2 and sub-sections.</p>

<h4 id="3228-certification-authority-authorization-caa-records">3.2.2.8 Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Records</h4>
<p>For Domain Validation TLS Server Authentication certificates and Organization Validation TLS Server Authentication certificates, CAs shall check and verify CAA records.  CAs shall follow the processing instructions found, for each dNSName in the subjectAltName extension of the certificate to be issued, as specified in RFC 6844 as amended by Errata 5065. If the CA issues, the CA shall issue within the Time to Live (TTL) of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>When processing CAA records, CAs shall process the issue, issuewild, and iodef property tags as specified in RFC 6844, although they are not required to act on the contents of the iodef property tag. Additional property tags may be supported, but shall not conflict with or supersede the mandatory property tags set out in this policy. CAs shall respect the critical flag and not issue a certificate if they encounter an unrecognized property with this flag set. CAs may treat a non-empty CAA Resource Record Set that does not contain any issue property tags (and also does not contain any issuewild property tags when performing CAA processing for a Wildcard Domain Name) as permission to issue, provided that no records in the CAA Resource Record Set otherwise prohibit issuance.</p>

<p>CAs are permitted to treat a record lookup failure as permission to issue only if all the following are true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The failure is outside the CA’s infrastructure</li>
  <li>The lookup has been retried at least once</li>
  <li>The domain’s zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the ICANN root</li>
</ul>

<p>CAs shall document potential issuances that were prevented by a CAA record in sufficient detail to provide feedback on the circumstances, and should dispatch reports of such issuance requests to the contact(s) stipulated in the CAA iodef record(s), if present. CAs are not expected to support URL schemes in the iodef record other than mailto: or https:.</p>

<h4 id="323-authentication-of-individual-identity">3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity</h4>

<p>This section specifies the X.509 version 3 certificate profiles, version 2 Certificate Revocation List (CRL) profile, and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Response profile for the U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI Certificate Policy.  In cases where the profiles and Section 7 of this CP are in conflict, Section 7 takes precedence and is authoritative.</p>

<p>Certificates issued under this policy are categorized as CA Certificates, Subscriber Certificates or Infrastructure Certificates.  This Certificate Policy defines five (5) different types of certificates (See Section 1.1.3) and four associated certificate profiles.</p>
